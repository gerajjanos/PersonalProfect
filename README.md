# PersonalProfect
This is a project that I made for someone. It was fully coded by me.
The design was made by a designer (not me obviously :)) ).
I tried to program the back-end of the online shop with not too much success since it was my first ever try to do such a thing.
I had to learn almost everything about front-end development by myself so I'm pretty sure that it has errors in it. Atleast its pixel perfect :))
